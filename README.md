Implement a Design with Bootstrap (Max's Version)

For this project Max said to create a website themed
around a hobby of mine so of course I chose Star Wars!

I wanted to create a dealership style website but instead
of selling cars they would be selling salvaged and rebuilt
starships from the stra wars universe, Rebel and Imperial 
alike!
